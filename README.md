# Zahuczky's KFX Guide
Here you can find the HTML source files for my KFX guide that lives at [https://zahuczky.com/](https://zahuczky.com/)
The files only contain plain HTML, and they're embedded in my site.

You can contribute to the guide here.
## Contribution rules
- If you decide to contribute to the guide, try not to rewrite the entire thing, and try to refrain from opinionated statements.
- Still, it's not a technical document, but a guide. Know the reader on the other end of the screen is a person, feel free to communicate to them.
- Example images should always use black checkboarded background, with white text/black border. The recommended font is Nyala. 
- [Here's a link [to a ](https://files.catbox.moe/zyzj6l.mp4)1-minute[ long dummy](https://files.catbox.moe/zyzj6l.mp4) video you can use as background](https://files.catbox.moe/zyzj6l.mp4) with this you can use petzku's encode clip script.
- Animated examples should be GIF files, not videos. Try to maintain a good quality when converting it to a GIF.
- Add all images to the img folder, and link them as `https://files.zahuczky.com/kfx/image.png`. 
- For syntax highlighting, just wrap your text in `<ass></ass>` HTML tags. The rather janky and fragile JS code for this can be found in the tools folder.
- If you contribute to a page, add yourself to the contributors list at the bottom of the given page. Your name can be a link as well if you would like it to link somewhere. 
- For anything, that these rules don't cover, follow the practices previously used in the guide, or if there's nothing like that present, follow common sense.
