> *Audio Panel Inside Aegisub*


Let’s quickly go through what you can find in the audio panel.  
The three sliders to the right control vertical and horizontal zoom on your audio visualization, and volume. Go ahead and play with them a bit.

Inside your visualizer, you can see three distinct “lines”, a red, white and blue one.  
The red line is the start time of your line.  
The blue line is the end time of your line.  
The white is the current position of your playback cursor.

There’s also a plethora of buttons under the visualizer, let’s quickly go through all of them.

They play a bit before your line, a bit after your line, a bit after the start of your line, and a bit before the end of your line, respectively. With these you can make sure your timing is always on spot, and never bleeds.|
